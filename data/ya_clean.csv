In this troubled world, Mr Watts decides he will open the school once more, and read 'Great Expectations' by Charles Dickens aloud to his students, a chapter a day. Stories flourish on the island. While the lives of Pip and Magwitch and other characters from 'Great Expectations' are transformed in their new tropical setting, the locals come to the schoolhouse to tell their own tales, about the meaning of the colour blue, about broken dreams, black birds, devil women and a dozen other subjects. In Matilda's eyes, Pip is as real as any living person. He has become her friend. She writes his name in the sand and decorates it with shells. That's where the redskin soldiers see it, and decide they must track this stranger down. Who is this Mr Pip? The search to find him will have devastating consequences for Matilda, Mr Watts and the entire village. Matilda may never stop looking for him.",1,John Murray,2008-01-10,240,071956994X,9780719569944,"historical fiction,war story,young adult"

But something is wrong in this family. Sisters Carlie and Sarah don't know if they'll get dinner, or be able to take a bath, or talk on the phone.

Extravagant parties, messy relationships and shameless ambition are just some of the excesses of the bling boys from Tribeca. But when Jonathan's cute cousin from St Louis arrives on the scene, they have a challenge on their hands.

After trying to drown her feelings with her first ever experiment with alcohol, she is woken early by her mother one Sunday morning.
